This blockchain implementation involved creating a chain of blocks where each block contains transaction data, a timestamp, a hash of the block's contents, and the hash of the previous block. Key components include:

SHA-256 Hashing: Used to generate unique, tamper-proof fingerprints for each block.

Proof of Work (PoW): A consensus algorithm that requires miners to solve a computational puzzle by finding a valid nonce to produce a hash with a certain number of leading zeros.

Merkle Root: A hash representing all transactions in a block, allowing for efficient verification of transaction integrity.

Transactions: Represent the transfer of value between wallets, secured by digital signatures.

Mining: The process of solving PoW to add new blocks to the chain, with miners being rewarded through a special coinbase transaction.

This ensures decentralization, security, and immutability in the blockchain.
